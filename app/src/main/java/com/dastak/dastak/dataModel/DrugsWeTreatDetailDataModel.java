            "Methamphetamine is a white crystalline drug that people take by snorting it (inhaling through the nose), smoking it or injecting it with a needle. Some even take it orally, but all develop a strong desire to continue using it because the dilig creates a false sense of happiness and well-being a rush (strong feeling) of confidence, hyper activeness, and energy. One also experiences decreased appetite. These dilig effects generally last from six to eight hours but can last up to twenty-four hours.",
            "The word cocaine refers to the drug in a powder form or crystal form. The powder is usually mixed with substances such as corn starch, talcum powder and/or sugar or other drugs such as procaine (a local anesthetic) or amphetamines.\n" +

                    "Cocaine is one of the most dangerous drugs known to man. a impossible to become free of its grip physically and mentally. Physically it stimulates key receptors (nerve endings that sense changes in the body) within the brain that, in turn, creates a euphoria to which users quickly develop a tolerance. Only higher dosages and more frequent use can bring about the same effect.",
            "LSD is one of the most potent, mood-changing chemicals. It is manufactured from lysergic acid, which is found in the ergot fungus that grows on rye and other grains.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "It is produced in crystal form in illegal laboratories. These crystals are converted to a liquid for distribution. It is odorless, colorless, and has a slightly bitter taste\n" +

                    "absorbent paper, which is then divided into small squares decorated with designs or cartoon characters. Occasionally it is sold in liquid form. But no matter what form it comes in, LSD leads the user to the same place a serious disconnection from reality.",
            "Heroin is a highly addictive, illegal drug. It is used by millions of addicts around the world who are unable to overcome the urge to continue taking this drug every day of their lives—knowing that if they stop, they will face the horror of withdrawal.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Most heroin is injected, creating additional risks for the user, who faces the danger of AIDS or other infection on top of the pain of addiction.",
            "Synthetic drugs are created using man-made chemicals rather than natural ingredients. A designer drug is a synthetic (chemically made) version of an illegal drug that was slightly altered to avoid having it classified as illegal. It is essentially an experiment by a chemist done to create a new drug that can be sold legally (on the Internet or in stores), allowing dealers to make money without breaking the law. As law enforcement catches up with new chemicals that are so created and makes them illegal, manufacturers devise altered versions to steer clear of the law. So the cycle repeats.",
            "Inhalants\" refer to the vapors from toxic substances that are inhaled to reach a quick high. Of more than I ,000 household and other common products that could be abused as inhalants, most often used are shoe polish, glue, toluene, gasoline, lighter fluid, nitrous oxide or \"whippets\" spray paint, correction fluid, cleaning fluid, amyl nitrite or \"poppers\" locker room deodorizers or \"rush\" and paint solvents.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Most of these produce effects similar to anesthetics, which slow down the body's functions. After an initial high and loss of inhibition comes drowsiness, light-headedness, and agitation.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The chemicals are rapidly absorbed through the lungs into the bloodstream and quickly reach the brain and other organs, sometimes causing irreversible physical and mental damage.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Users inhale the chemical vapors directly from open containers (\"sniffing\") or breathe the fumes from rags soaked in chemicals (\"huffing\"). Some spray the substance directly into the nose or mouth, or pour it onto their collar, sleeves or cuffs and sniff them periodically.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Due to the constantly growing number of chemicals that are developed, designer drug users have no way of knowing what the drugs they take might contain. Further, as a small modification made to a known drug may result—and often does—in a new drug with greatly different effects, users cannot predict the impact on health from the substances they experiment with.",
            "Marijuana is one of the most abused drugs in the world. There are over 400 chemicals in marijuana and hashish. The chemical that causes intoxication or the \"high\" in users is called THC (short for tetrahydrocannabinol). THC creates the mind-altering effect that classifies marijuana as a \"drug\"\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "You may have heard someone say that because ImageMarijuana is a plant, it is \"natural\" and so it is harmless. But it is not! Hemlock, a poisonous plant, is also \"natural\" but it can kill.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The other thing to know is that burning dried leaves and buds and inhaling the smoke into your lungs is not \"natural\" and like smoking cigarettes, it is harmful to your body.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The mental consequences of marijuana use are equally severe. Marijuana smokers have poorer memories and mental aptitude than do non-users.",
            "Alcohol is a drug\n" +
                    "It is classed as a depressant, meaning that it slows down vital functions—resulting in slurred speech, unsteady movement, disturbed perceptions and an inability to react quickly.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "As for how it affects the mind, it is best understood as a drug that reduces a person's ability to think rationally and distorts his or her judgment.\n" +

                    "Alcohol overdose causes effects like inability to feel pain, toxicity where the body vomits the poison, and finally unconsciousness or, worse, coma or death from a severe toxic overdose. These reactions depend on how much is consumed and how quickly.",
            "Tragically, Ecstasy is one of the most popular drugs among youth today. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime estimates Ecstasy users to number approximately 9 million worldwide. The vast majority of users are teenagers and young adults",
            "Ritalin is the common name for methylphenidate. It is abused by teens for their stimulant effects. Even when Ritalin is used as a prescription drug, it may have severe effects including nervousness, insomnia, anorexia, loss of appetite, pulse changes, heart problems, and weight loss. The manufacturer says it is a drug of dependency.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Ritalin and drugs like it may cause visual hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, and psychotic behavior, as well as aggression or violent behavior",
            "Among teens, prescription drugs are the most commonly used drugs next to marijuana, and almost half of the teens abusing prescription drugs are taking painkillers.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Why are so many young people turning to prescription drugs to get high?\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "By survey, almost 50% of teens believe that taking prescription drugs is much safer than using illegal street drugs.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "What is not known by most of these young people is the risk they are taking by consuming these highly potent and mind-altering drugs. Long-term use of painkillers can lead to dependence, even for people who are prescribed them to relieve a medical condition but eventually fall into the trap of abuse and addiction.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "In some cases, the dangers of painkillers don't surface until it is too late. In 2007, for example, abuse of the painkiller Fentanyl killed more than 1,000 people. The drug was found to be thirty to fifty times more powerful than heroin.",
            "Many teens think prescription drugs are safe because they were prescribed by a doctor. But taking them for non-medical use to get high or \"self-medicate\" can be just as dangerous and addictive as taking illegal street drugs.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "There are very serious health risks in taking prescription drugs. This is why they are taken only under the care of a doctor. And even then, they have to be closely monitored to avoid addiction or other problems.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Many pills look the same. It is extremely dangerous to take any pill that you are uncertain about or was not prescribed for you. People can also have different reactions to drugs due to the differences in each person's body chemistry. A drug that was okay for one person could be very risky, even fatal, for someone else.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Prescription drugs are only safe for individuals who have prescriptions for them and no one else",

                    "crack the most potent form in which cocaine appears, is also the riskiest. It is between 75% and 100% pure, far stronger and more potent than regular cocaine\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "By smoking crack allows it to reach the brain more quickly and thus brings an intense and immediate, but very short-lived high that lasts about fifteen minutes. And because can develop even more rapidly if the substance is smoked rather than snorted in through the nose), an abuser can become addicted after his or her first time crack."};
